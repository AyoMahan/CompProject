# CompProject
Mini Projects done in my object oriented programming courses
The censor project involves using file IO as well as the scanner class. the purpose of the program is to take an original text file with random text with recurring words called the source file. Then another file "badlist" will contain a list of strings that you would like to censor from the source file. Then using a file writer, as well as an algorithm, the program will create destination file which is the original file but censored from the words in the badlist, replacing them with **.
